Task 1: load this to your local database and make api to fetch the data based on each stock
Learn about api; post get put delete requests.
•	Used postgre as Database
step 1: made column header name as that of .csv file given in pgadmin 4 
step 2: imported the csv file in the pgadmin for the table name “stocks” (tried using python but CSV was imported,  no data was seen on the pgadmin.)
Step 3: using flask and SQLAlchemy extensions created a simple api
Step 4 : while creating api 
•	First connected to the postgresql using SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI  
•	Then created a db.model for all the listed stock names 
 
Using get method to retrieve data from the db. we are using ticker to retrieve data rather than stock name.  
Then on browser checking the api with http://127.0.0.1:5000/stocks/<ticker>
